# Gesture-based Musical Notation Editor (Spring 2023)

This is a project of a musical notation system editor. This is a free Java class provided by Professor Marlin at NEU Seattle. We spent one semester building this editor.

Used IntelliJ IDEA.

Install the font provided: `sinfonia.ttf`
Run `MusicED.java` to draw lines, put notations, etc.
Run `ShapeTrainer.java` to train shape.

## Features
- Created a musical notation editor using Java and MVC design, allowing intuitive gesture-based input for musical symbols, improving user experience and editing efficiency.

- Engineered a shape trainer to train and interpret mouse gestures, enabling intuitive drawing of diverse musical symbols (e.g., a south-to-south gesture draws a bar line). Implemented functionality to dynamically recognize and blend new shapes into the existing database, enhancing the system's adaptability and accuracy.

- Developed the Music Editor component, which includes real-time gesture handling, dynamic staff and system creation, and multi-layer management. Utilized layers for organizing musical elements, ensuring correct positioning and easy manipulation.

- Implemented undo functionality to allow users to revert actions, enhancing control over the editing process.
Tech Stack: Java, MVC, Swing
