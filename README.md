# MusicEditor

This is a project of a musical notation system editor. This is a free Java class provided by Professor Marlin at NEU Seattle. We spent one semester building this editor.

Used IntelliJ IDEA.

Run `MusicED.java` to draw lines, put notations, etc.
Run `ShapeTrainer.java` to train shape.

## Features
- Designed and developed a Java-based musical notation editor encompassing over 20 classes.
- Leveraged the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for clear separation of concerns.
- Engineered a shape trainer to interpret mouse gestures, enabling intuitive drawing of diverse musical symbols such as staff, clef, notes, and rests. For example, a south-to-south gesture draws a bar line.
- Implemented layering functionality to streamline the editing process, ensuring symbols retain correct positioning or can be easily removed.
- Integrated specialized fonts to render standardized musical notations with precision placement within the editor.

## Additional Description
