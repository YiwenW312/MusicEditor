# MusicEditor
This is a project of musical notation system editor. This is a free java class provided by Professor Marlin in NEU Seattle. We spent 1 semester to build this editor. 

Used intelliJ IDEA 

run MusicED.java to draw lines, put notations, etc. 

* Designed and developed a JAVA-based musical notation editor encompassing over 20 classes.
* Leveraged the Model-View-Controller (MVC) for clear separation of concerns.
* Engineered a shape trainer to interpret mouse gestures, enabling intuitive drawing of diverse musical symbols such as staff, clef, notes, and rests. E.g., a south-to-south gesture draws a bar line.
* Implemented layering functionality to streamline the editing process, ensuring symbols retain correct positioning or can be easily removed.
* Integrated specialized fonts to render standardized musical notations with precision placement within the editor.
